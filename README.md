**CRIME IN LOS ANGELES, 2020-2023**

**Team members:** Ledy De La Rosa 

**Description of the project:** 
This report will cover the foundational knowledge I gathered while analyzing crime data on Los Angeles from 2020-2023. The main goal of my analysis is to find patterns and trends within Los Angeles that could be useful in many different areas such as crime prevention, law creation, police force placements within neighborhoods, and caution  individuals. The way my report is set out, I have four different clusters or categoriesI i'll be placing close attention to. There categories are crime,victim, weapon and rape. I decided to focus on rape specifically out of all the other crimes because I would like to help the women in our communities by finding concrete statistics that we could potentially use in the future to decrease the chances of another female being raped. I hope to contribute to this goal by evaluating my results and coming up with reliable solutions. 

**Summary of the question(s) sought and the answers:** 
I created four different categories where I focused on answering the following questions: 
Crime: 
1.Which crime has the highest average?
2.During which month do we see the highest crime rates? 
3.Which area experiences the most crime? 
4.Which hour is most prone to crime?

Victim: 
1.Which age group experiences more crime?
2.How does the victimâ€™s descent affect their experiences with crime?
3.Which area do females experience the most crimes? 
4.Which sex has a higher predisposition to crime?

Weapons:
1.Which area has the highest number of crimes involving a weapon?
2.Average number of weapons used 
3.Which age group is most likely to be a victim of a crime involving a weapon? 

Rape:
1.Which hour rape occurs most often?
2.Which area we see rape happening the most?

**Application of this knowledge**
Precautionary measures can be drawn from my conclusions to identify which crime affects who groups the most specifically, which sex, which race, and what age to help come up with strategies to ensure the safety of our communities.
